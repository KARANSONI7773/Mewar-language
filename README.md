# Mewar Programming Language (v1.0)

Welcome to Mewar, a programming language designed from the ground up for absolute beginners. Our core philosophy is that code should be readable, intuitive, and easy to learn.



## Core Features
* **Simple English Syntax**: Commands like `set`, `say`, `repeat`, and `if` make code easy to write and understand.
* **Beginner-Friendly**: With just a handful of keywords, you can learn the entire language in an afternoon.
* **1-Based Indexing**: Lists start at 1, just like in the real world.
* **Complete**: Supports variables, lists, I/O, loops, conditionals, and functions.

## Getting Started

You can run Mewar code in just a few steps.

### 1. You Will Need
* Python 3 installed on your system.
* The `veer.py` interpreter file.

### 2. Write Your First Program
Create a new text file and name it `hello.mewar`. Type the following code into it:

```mewar
# My first Mewar program
say "Hello from the historic land of Mewar!"
